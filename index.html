                <p>
                    Though I was born in Texas, I grew up in Southern
                    California. I went to an arts conservatory high school,
                    where I
                    studied Production & Design. It was there that I learned how
                    to
                    build sets, set up lighting and audio systems, apply stage
                    makeup, and use a sewing machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite class was physics because the teacher was super
                    cool. To demonstrate circular motion, he brought in a boom
                    box and did headspins in the midde of class. I later went on
                    to study physics and math in college.
